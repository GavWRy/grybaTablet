		<p>One of my favorite movies I have ever seen is Leningrad Cowboys Go America. I can not describe what about it is so appealing to me, but from start to finish, I was hooked and fully invested in the Leningrad Cowboys's journey.</p>

		<p>Another great film is Hot Fuzz directed by Edgar Wright. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost continue the Coronetto Trilogy with a story of buddy cops in a quiet town</p>
