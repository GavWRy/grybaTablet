		<p>I a third year student at the University of Michigan. I am pursuing dual degrees, one in Information, the other in Film.</p>

		<p>This website will bridge the gap between Film and Information by providing a place to showcase my film works and experiences, as well as various other topics such as my opinions on recent films and new releases. This website is still under construction.</p>
